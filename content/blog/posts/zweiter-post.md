If you’re not being fucking honest with yourself how could you ever hope to communicate something meaningful to someone else? Someday is not a fucking day of the week. If you fucking give up, you will achieve nothing. Design as if your fucking life depended on it. Creativity is a fucking work-ethic. What’s important is the fucking drive to see a project through no matter what. Respect your fucking craft. Practice won’t get you anywhere if you mindlessly fucking practice the same thing. Change only occurs when you work deliberately with purpose toward a goal. You need to sit down and sketch more fucking ideas because stalking your ex on facebook isn’t going to get you anywhere. Nothing of value comes to you without fucking working at it. You won’t get good at anything by doing it a lot fucking aimlessly. The details are not the details. They make the fucking design. This design is fucking brilliant. Don’t fucking lie to yourself. Learn from fucking criticism. Design is all about fucking relationships—the relationship of form and content, the relationship of elements, the relationship of designer and user. Form follows fucking function. Use your fucking hands.
