Hey, my name is Evi and I am your guide through the vast land of food!
Here we discover everything about conscious and healthy food, because we want to cook delicious food for big and small adventurers!
Just don't forget your logbook, which we will fill with valuable information about all imaginable ingredients and their preparation on our travels.

Let's start this odyssey with an extensive breakfast in the sunshine.
Afterwards we enjoy starters and drinks during a long walk through the sights of these endless lands.
Following that I can't withhold hearty treats from you, of course, so that even the last corner of our hunger is satisfied.
At the end of our journey I will sweeten your farewell to this fascinating world with delicious desserts, enchanting pastries and juicy cakes.

Was I able to arouse your interest?
Then let's say yes together to a conscious and healthy diet, where you don't have to give up anything!
With little effort everyone can take advantage of this diversity.
Because, as Georges Auguste Escoffier said: "A good kitchen is the foundation of all happiness".

So, in conclusion, we can say that in all our travels, adventures and expeditions, there is one motto that runs like the yellow brick road that winds through this magical realm:

*enjoy ingredients*
